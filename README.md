# in-season

In-season is a full stack web application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). 

This was my first attempt working with this stack and I loved every high (and oddly, ever low too)!

Sustainability is a big passion of mine and eating local makes a difference when it comes to reducing your carbon footprint.

In-season allows you to find out what local foods (Vegetables, Fruits, Herbs, Seafood) in BC are in season based on the month. 

Big thanks to my web-dev guru/friend @LaurynBassett (https://github.com/laurynbassett) for helping me through the struggles of redux!

Enjoy!
